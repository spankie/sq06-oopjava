# OOP (Object oriented programming)

examples of OOP languages: Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++

Java is a true OOP language as everything is an object

- CLASS:
  `A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't consume any space.`

- INHERITANCE: `When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism.`

- POLYMORPHISM. `Polymorphism means having different forms. This concept is recognized by objects having 'IS-A relationship'`.

  types of polymorphism includes:

  - compile time polymorphism (static binding) - Overloading
  - runtime polymorphism (Dynamic polymorphism) - Inheritance

- ABSTRACTION
  `is a process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user. this is achieved in java using abstract classes and interfaces.`
  - `example is sending email, or making http requests`
  - this is achieved using interfaces and abstract methods
  - allows for better testing
  - help make code resilient to change

- ENCAPSULATION
  `Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.`
  - this can be acheieved using access modifiers and getter/setters

Other concepts to learn:

- Coupling
- Cohesion
- Association
- Aggregation
- Composition
- how many interfaces can an interface extend?

Q: how many classes can a class extend
Q: how many interfaces can a class implement

## Access modifiers
- private
- default
- public
- protected
  
_A class cannot be private or protected except nested class._
